- Local IP address assignment continues to work
- SSH access may remain available (if previously enabled)

### Database and Files

- SQLite database (`index.db`) remains intact with all metadata

## Timeline of ibi Product Lifecycle

- **2016**: SanDisk ibi launched as "smart photo manager"
- **2017-2023**: Active development and cloud service support
- **2024**: End of life announcement and service termination
- **August 31, 2024**: Official end of support date
- **Future**: Local access may degrade over time due to lack of updates

## Why Western Digital Discontinued ibi

Based on their official statement, the discontinuation was part of a strategic shift:

1. **Customer Experience Focus**: WD wanted to consolidate around products that fit their current ecosystem
2. **Legacy Product Retirement**: ibi was considered no longer aligned with company direction
3. **Resource Allocation**: Focus development resources on current product lines
4. **Market Evolution**: Consumer photo storage needs have shifted toward cloud-first solutions

## Impact on Users

### Immediate (August 31, 2024)

- Loss of remote access and mobile apps
- Inability to add new content via cloud imports
- End of automatic backup features

### Medium-term (Months)

- Potential local access issues if network configuration changes
- Increasing difficulty accessing stored content
- No security updates for known vulnerabilities

### Long-term (Years)

- Hardware may continue working but software becomes increasingly obsolete
- Risk of permanent data loss due to device failure with no recovery options
- Local network access may stop working due to router updates or protocol changes

## Lessons for Data Management

The ibi discontinuation highlights several important principles:

1. **Avoid Vendor Lock-in**: Keep copies of data in standard formats
2. **Regular Backups**: Don't rely solely on proprietary storage devices
3. **Open Standards**: Use file formats and storage methods that don't depend on specific companies
4. **Community Solutions**: Open source tools provide long-term data access when vendors discontinue products
